### Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

* __Syntax Error:__ This type of error occurs when there is a violation of the language's syntax rules. It's often detected by the compiler or interpreter and prevents the program from running. Syntax errors are usually related to issues like missing semicolons, parentheses, or incorrect variable names.
* __Logic Error:__ A logic error, on the other hand, doesn't result in a program crash, but it causes the program to behave incorrectly. These errors are related to flawed program logic or incorrect algorithms. They can be challenging to identify since the code runs without error messages, but it produces unintended results.

### List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

__In past lab assignments, I encountered a range of errors, including:__

* __Syntax Errors:__ These were typically caused by missing semicolons, mismatched parentheses, or typos in variable names. I corrected them by carefully reviewing the code and fixing the syntax issues.
* __Logic Errors:__ These were often related to incorrect conditional statements or algorithmic mistakes. To correct them, I used the debugging tools from VC and reviewed my code logic step by step.
* __Runtime Errors:__ Such errors were typically caused by accessing an undefined variable. I handled them by adding proper error checks and validating inputs.

### How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

Understanding and mastering debugging techniques, error resolution, and the use of debugging tools is essential for long-term success in software development. It enhances problem-solving skills, code quality, and efficiency, making it a fundamental aspect of achieving long-term development goals.

### How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The JavaScript Debugger is a tool that allows developers to inspect, monitor, and debug JavaScript code in web applications. It helps identify and rectify errors in the code. It works by enabling you to set breakpoints, step through code execution, inspect variables, and view the call stack. This tool is vital for locating and resolving issues in JavaScript applications, making it a valuable resource for developers.

### Define what a breakpoint is.

A breakpoint is a designated point in your code where the debugger will pause the execution of the program, allowing you to inspect the program's state at that moment. It's a debugging tool that helps you analyze variables, step through code, and identify the root cause of issues. Breakpoints are essential for pinpointing errors and understanding code behavior.

### What is the call stack?

The call stack is a data structure used to keep track of function calls in a program. It records the order in which functions are called and their respective contexts. When a function is called, it's added to the top of the call stack, and when it returns, it's removed. The call stack is vital for understanding the flow of a program and is particularly useful in debugging and tracking the sequence of function calls.
