### To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

To create a basic link in HTML, you wrap text or other content inside an \<a> (anchor) element.

### The href attribute contains what information?

The href attribute contains information about the destination or URL to which a hyperlink (link) points.

### What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

Utilize appropriate HTML elements to convey the structure and purpose of your content. For example, use headings for headings, lists for lists, and buttons for interactive elements.

### What is meant by “normal flow”?

It's the default way elements are laid out in a web page, either stacking vertically (block-level) or flowing horizontally alongside text (inline).

### What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

* __Block-Level:__ Create new blocks, have width and height, and cause line breaks.
* __Inline:__ Flow within text, affect only height, and don't cause line breaks.

### _Static Positioning_ positioning is the default for every html element.
 
### Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

Precise placement, layering, overlap, and independence from other elements.

### What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

* __Fixed Positioning:__ Elements are positioned relative to the viewport and stay fixed while scrolling.
* __Absolute Positioning:__ Elements are positioned relative to the nearest non-static ancestor or the viewport, and they move with the page's content when scrolling.

### Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

* __Function Declaration:__ This defines a function by giving it a name and specifying what it does. It doesn't execute the function; it's like a recipe.

* __Function Invocation:__ This is when you actually use or run the function. You provide the data it needs to work with, and it performs its task.

### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

* __Parameter:__ A variable in the function declaration that acts as a placeholder for the data the function will receive when it's called.

* __Argument:__ The actual data or value that you provide when calling the function, replacing the parameters to perform the function's task.


### Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

* __Enhanced Learning:__ Pairing with others allows for knowledge exchange and skill development, making it a valuable tool for continuous learning and improvement.
* __Improved Code Quality:__ With two sets of eyes on the code, pair programming leads to better code quality, error detection, and adherence to coding standards, ensuring robust and maintainable software. These benefits are essential for growth and producing high-quality code on my coding journey.
