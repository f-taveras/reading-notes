### Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

Flexbox is intended for arranging elements along a single axis, making it suitable for either horizontal or vertical layouts, but not both simultaneously.

### Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

The main axis is the primary alignment direction in flexbox, while the cross axis is the perpendicular direction. Elements are primarily arranged along the main axis.

### How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

Using properties like _'order'_ in flexbox to change the visual order of elements can disrupt the logical order for screen readers. Overusing flexbox for complex layouts and neglecting semantic HTML can create accessibility issues. 



### What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
* __Simplified Layouts:__ Flexbox simplifies complex layouts, making it easier to achieve designs that were traditionally challenging with floats.

* __Content Independence:__ Flexbox allows elements to be independent of their parent container's dimensions, reducing layout constraints.

* __Equal Height Columns:__ Flexbox can create equal-height columns without additional hacks.

* __Vertical Centering:__ It provides straightforward vertical centering of content.

* __Order Control:__ Elements' visual order can be adjusted without changing the source order.

* __Responsive Design:__ Flexbox simplifies responsive design by allowing dynamic reordering and resizing.
