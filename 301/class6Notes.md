### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

due to scalability, interoperability, and heterogeneity challenges. Solutions that work well in smaller, controlled environments may not be suitable for the vast and diverse landscape of the entire internet.

### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

The __HTTP__ protocol that Roy Fielding and his colleagues created is __HTTP/1.1__ _(Hypertext Transfer Protocol, version 1.1)_. It is a widely used protocol for communication on the World Wide Web and forms the foundation for data communication in the World Wide Web.
