| SQL      | NoSQL |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| __DataStructure__      | SQL databases are table-based and follow a rigid, structured schema. Each row in a table represents a record, and columns define the data types.
| Scalability   | SQL databases are typically scaled vertically by increasing the horsepower (CPU, RAM, SSD) on a single server.
| ACID Properties   | SQL databases follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to ensure the reliability of transactions.
|Query Language   | SQL databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) for defining and manipulating the data.
| Example Databases | Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.

### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

* __Data with Well-Defined Structure:__ SQL databases are suitable for data with a well-defined and consistent structure. If your data fits neatly into tables with predefined relationships, SQL is a good choice.

* __Online Retail System:__ A relational database can be used to store information about customers, orders, products, and inventory in a structured manner. Each table (e.g., Customers, Orders, Products) has predefined columns and relationships.



### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

* __Unstructured or Semi-Structured Data:__ NoSQL databases are suitable for data with a flexible or changing structure. If your data is document-oriented, hierarchical, or doesn't fit neatly into tables, NoSQL can be a good fit.
Real-World Example:

* __Content Management System (CMS):__ NoSQL databases like MongoDB are suitable for storing content in a CMS. Content can vary in structure and include documents, images, metadata, and user-generated content.



### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

* __NoSQL Database (Document Store):__ NoSQL databases, especially document stores, are well-suited for hierarchical data storage. The nested and nested-array structures in documents align well with hierarchical data.

### Which type of database is best for scalability?

* __NoSQL Database (Distributed):__ NoSQL databases, designed for horizontal scalability, are well-suited for handling large amounts of data and traffic. Adding more servers to a NoSQL database helps achieve scalability.
