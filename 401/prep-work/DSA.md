### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

One of the most important considerations when choosing a data structure is to assess its efficiency for the specific operations required by your problem. To avoid an infinite recursive call stack:

### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

* Always define a base case in your recursive function.
* Limit the depth of recursion or use iteration as an alternative.
* Utilize tail recursion if supported by your programming language.
* Test and debug your recursive functions thoroughly to ensure termination.
