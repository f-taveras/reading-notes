## What are the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?

Serverless computing is a cloud computing model that abstracts the underlying infrastructure management from developers. Here are key characteristics that differentiate it from traditional server-based architectures:

* __No Server Management:__ In serverless, you don't need to provision, configure, or manage servers. The cloud provider handles this automatically.
* __Event-Driven:__ Serverless functions are triggered by events, such as HTTP requests, file uploads, database changes, or timers.
* __Pay-Per-Use:__ You're billed based on the actual usage of resources (e.g., compute time) rather than pre-allocated servers.
* __Scalability:__ Serverless platforms automatically scale your application as needed to handle incoming requests.
* __Statelessness:__ Functions are stateless, meaning they don't retain data between invocations.

## How can one get started with Vercel, and what are the main steps involved in deploying a serverless function using Vercel?

Vercel is a platform for deploying web applications, including serverless functions. Here are the main steps to deploy a serverless function using Vercel:
* __Sign Up:__ Create a Vercel account or log in if you already have one.
* __Install CLI:__ Install the Vercel CLI tool on your local machine.
* __Initialize Project:__ In your project directory, run vercel init to set up your project with Vercel.
* __Configure Function:__ Write your serverless function (usually in Node.js or Python) and include it in your project.
* __Deploy:__ Use vercel deploy to deploy your project, including the serverless function.
* __Test:__ Once deployed, you can test your function by visiting the provided URL.

## What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?

An API _(Application Programming Interface)_ is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another. In Python, you can use APIs to access and manipulate data from external sources, such as web services or databases. APIs enable your Python applications to send HTTP requests to remote servers and receive data in various formats, like JSON or XML.

## What is the Requests library in Python, and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?

The __requests__ library is a popular Python library for making HTTP requests to interact with APIs. You can use it to send __GET, POST, PUT, DELETE__, and other HTTP requests. Here's an example of making a basic __GET__ request using the requests library:
```
import requests

# URL of the API you want to access
url = 'https://api.example.com/data'

# Send a GET request
response = requests.get(url)

# Check if the request was successful (status code 200)
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the response content (assuming it's JSON)
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
```
In this example, we import the requests library, send a GET request to a URL, and handle the response. You can replace 'https://api.example.com/data' with the actual API endpoint you want to access.
