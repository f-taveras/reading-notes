* [The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e)

* [The cybersecurity risk of self-driving cars](https://phys.org/news/2017-02-cybersecurity-self-driving-cars.html)


analyzing these articles, both highlight the ethical implications of technology in different contexts. Sourour's article on unethical coding practices for a pharmaceutical company emphasizes the moral responsibility of developers in creating technology that impacts lives directly. I agree with the need for ethical considerations in coding, as it resonates with the broader implications of technology on society. Kirda's discussion on self-driving cars and cybersecurity stresses the importance of secure coding and industry-government cooperation to protect against cyber threats. I agree with the emphasis on security but also recognize the complexity of achieving it. Both articles underline the ethical and security challenges in technology development, making me more aware of the responsibilities of those who create and implement technology.
