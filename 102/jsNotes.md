### What are variables in JavaScript?
Variables are essential components of JavaScript, serving as containers for storing data. They allow programmers to work with and manipulate various types of information, from numbers and text to more complex data structures.
### What does it mean to declare a variable?
To declare a variable in JavaScript is to formally create a named storage space for data. This involves using a keyword like var, let, or const, followed by a chosen variable name. This step is crucial in preparing the variable for use, but it doesn't assign a specific value until later in the code.

### What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?
 The "assignment" operator, represented by =, plays a pivotal role in JavaScript by allowing developers to assign or update the value of a variable. It functions by taking the value on its right side and storing it in the variable specified on its left side. This operation is fundamental in making variables dynamic and responsive to changing data.

### What is information received from the user called?
 In JavaScript, "user input" or "user data" refers to the information received from individuals interacting with a web application. This input can be gathered through various mechanisms, including input fields, prompts, forms, or user interactions with a web page. Incorporating user input enhances the interactivity and functionality of web-based applications.
